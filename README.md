# Healthcare Database Model: Enhanced Patient Care Coordination

**Creating a healthcare database starting from modelling EER models, relational mapping and implementing it in MySQL, Python and MongoDB**

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development and implementation of a comprehensive healthcare database model aimed at streamlining patient care coordination. By centralizing critical medical information such as patient records, healthcare provider details, appointment schedules, and medication information, the database model simplifies information management and enhances the efficiency of healthcare delivery. The project explores the conceptualization, design, and implementation of the database model, along with its integration with Python for data analysis and visualization.

## Key Components
1. **Database Modeling:** Conceptualization and design of a relational database model to manage patient records, appointments, medication details, and healthcare provider information.
2. **Implementation:** Deployment of the database model using MySQL, along with the mapping of conceptual models to relational models and the incorporation of primary and foreign keys for data integrity.
3. **Data Analysis:** Utilization of Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to access and analyze data stored in the database, generating insights through visualization.
4. **Query Examples:** Demonstration of various SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis, showcasing the versatility and functionality of the database model.
5. **Documentation:** Detailed documentation provided in Word files, offering a comprehensive guide on project execution and database utilization.

## Step by Step Databse Creation
- **Database Design:** Creation of Entity-Relationship (EER) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to conceptualize the database structure.
- **Relational Mapping:** Mapping of conceptual models to relational models, defining primary and foreign keys for data relationships.
- **Database Implementation:** Deployment of the database model using MySQL, comprising twenty-three tables to store patient, healthcare provider, appointment, medication, and other relevant information.
- **Data Analysis:** Accessing and analyzing database data using Python, with visualization of insights through scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms.
- **Query Execution:** Execution of SQL queries to retrieve specific data subsets, demonstrating the versatility and efficiency of the database model in handling complex data queries.

## Conclusion
The implementation of the healthcare database model signifies a significant advancement in patient care coordination, offering a centralized platform for managing medical information. By integrating data management with Python for analysis and visualization, the project enhances decision-making and improves service delivery in healthcare settings. With its robust design and comprehensive functionality, the database model contributes to shaping a more efficient and organized future for healthcare institutions.
